## Futhermore...

#### What is my workflow?

In this project:

1. I start from reading specification, thinking what I need to do.
2. Simply draw the draft UI in paper, list the component what I need.
3. Start coding.
4. After finish all requirements on spec, I starting to improve styling and animation, like adding [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/basics).
5. Open Github private repo.
6. Deploy

And here is my real work experience if you want to know:

Before starting, I like to write some thoughts or scope definition first, it is good to help me thinking and entering the situation quickly.

In task management, I prefer using an application like Jira, Asana and Notion to focus on **each task**, including development tasks, issue tasks, improvement tasks and test tasks.

In negotiation, if it is about whole project, which can be discussed in our team communication application, like Slack. If it is about task, just discuss under each task in our task management application.

In development, open Pull Request for each task or task's sub task. Must one of reviewers approved and CI test success, the PR can be merged into master.

Thanks for your reading.
